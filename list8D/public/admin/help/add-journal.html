<ul>
	<li>Entering the Journal title and the article title only. The system will search our Serials Solutions
 (e-journals) database and if the article is found, will insert a link directly to it. Occasionally,
although we have access to the on-line article, the link will only go to the Journal front page.
When an online copy is not available then the link will go to the library catalogue for hard copy
holdings.</li>
<li>Entering the articles 'DOI' will ensure a definite link to the on-line article.</li>
