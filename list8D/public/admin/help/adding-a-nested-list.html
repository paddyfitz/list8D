	<h1>What is a nested list</h1> 
	<p>A nested list is a facility for attaching books to a specified section. This section can be in the form of Numbered Weeks, Numbered Seminars, Subjects, Recommended or Background reading etc. In the case of weekly/seminar reading you can set the dates in a Nested List to alert the library as to when the books will be in high demand. A sub nested list can also be created within an existing nested list.</p> 
	<h1>Adding a nested list</h1> 
	<ul><li>From 'Create new item' click on the 'Nested list' option to add information to the body of the reading list. This information could include: Title/Subject of a Heading, Week/Seminar number or title, Recommended/Background reading, Term, Screening, Websites etc.</li> 
	<li>Notes to students can also be added to this field.</li></ul> 
	<h1>Adding a sub nested list</h1> 
	<ul> 
	  <li>Create a sub nested list by dragging an existing nested list and dropping it into another existing list using the blue icon.</li> 
	</ul>
